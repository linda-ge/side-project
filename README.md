# MVP
## Pt. 1
This will be a Flask web server with a one-page application that displays random images of cats. 

Images will be stored as files in the web server.

The server will run on `localhost:5000/`.

## Pt. 2
This app will refresh to show a random image of a cat and an inspirational quote, updated daily.
